## 定义
在不破坏封闭的前提下，捕获一个对象的内部状态，并在该对象之外保存这个状态，这样，以后就可以将该对象恢复到原先保存的状态。

## 使用场景
(1):需要保存一个对象在某一时刻的状态或部分状态。
(2)：如果用一个接口来让其他对象得到这些状态，将会暴露对象的实现细节并破坏对象的封装性，一个对象不希望外界直接访问其内部状态，通过中间对象可以间接访问其内部状态。


## Android源码中的备忘录模式
##### Activity中的状态保存


```
/**
     * Called to retrieve per-instance state from an activity before being killed
     * so that the state can be restored in {@link #onCreate} or
     * {@link #onRestoreInstanceState} (the {@link Bundle} populated by this method
     * will be passed to both).
     *
     * <p>This method is called before an activity may be killed so that when it
     * comes back some time in the future it can restore its state.  For example,
     * if activity B is launched in front of activity A, and at some point activity
     * A is killed to reclaim resources, activity A will have a chance to save the
     * current state of its user interface via this method so that when the user
     * returns to activity A, the state of the user interface can be restored
     * via {@link #onCreate} or {@link #onRestoreInstanceState}.
     *
     * <p>Do not confuse this method with activity lifecycle callbacks such as
     * {@link #onPause}, which is always called when an activity is being placed
     * in the background or on its way to destruction, or {@link #onStop} which
     * is called before destruction.  One example of when {@link #onPause} and
     * {@link #onStop} is called and not this method is when a user navigates back
     * from activity B to activity A: there is no need to call {@link #onSaveInstanceState}
     * on B because that particular instance will never be restored, so the
     * system avoids calling it.  An example when {@link #onPause} is called and
     * not {@link #onSaveInstanceState} is when activity B is launched in front of activity A:
     * the system may avoid calling {@link #onSaveInstanceState} on activity A if it isn't
     * killed during the lifetime of B since the state of the user interface of
     * A will stay intact.
     *
     * <p>The default implementation takes care of most of the UI per-instance
     * state for you by calling {@link android.view.View#onSaveInstanceState()} on each
     * view in the hierarchy that has an id, and by saving the id of the currently
     * focused view (all of which is restored by the default implementation of
     * {@link #onRestoreInstanceState}).  If you override this method to save additional
     * information not captured by each individual view, you will likely want to
     * call through to the default implementation, otherwise be prepared to save
     * all of the state of each view yourself.
     *
     * <p>If called, this method will occur after {@link #onStop} for applications
     * targeting platforms starting with {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#P}.
     * For applications targeting earlier platform versions this method will occur
     * before {@link #onStop} and there are no guarantees about whether it will
     * occur before or after {@link #onPause}.
     *
     * @param outState Bundle in which to place your saved state.
     *
     * @see #onCreate
     * @see #onRestoreInstanceState
     * @see #onPause
     */
    protected void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState) {
        outState.putBundle(WINDOW_HIERARCHY_TAG, mWindow.saveHierarchyState());

        outState.putInt(LAST_AUTOFILL_ID, mLastAutofillId);
        Parcelable p = mFragments.saveAllState();
        if (p != null) {
            outState.putParcelable(FRAGMENTS_TAG, p);
        }
        if (mAutoFillResetNeeded) {
            outState.putBoolean(AUTOFILL_RESET_NEEDED, true);
            getAutofillManager().onSaveInstanceState(outState);
        }
        getApplication().dispatchActivitySaveInstanceState(this, outState);
    }
```


##### onSaveInstanceState的调用时机
当某个Activity变得容易被系统销毁时，该Activity的onSaveInstanceState函数就会被执行，除非该Activity是用户主动销毁的，如用户按Back键。

换句话说onSaveInstanceState的调用时机遵循一个原则，即当系统存在“未经你许可”时销毁了我们的Activity，onSaveInstanceState就会被系统调用，这是系统的责任，因为它必须要提供一个机会让用户保存数据。



## 小结
- 优点:1.给用户提供了一种可以恢复状态的机制，可以使用户能够比较方便地回到某个历史的状态。2，。实现了信息的封装，使得用户不需要关心状态的保存细节。
- 缺点：消耗资源，如果类的成员变量过多，势必会占用比较大的资源，而且每一次保存都会消耗一定的内存。
